## Troubleshooting

### "Error: AI service error"
**Problem:** API key not working
**Fix:** 
1. Check `backend/.env` has correct key
2. Make sure key starts with `sk-or-`
3. Verify you have credits on OpenRouter

### "Cannot connect to backend"
**Problem:** Backend not running
**Fix:**
1. Check backend terminal - should say "Uvicorn running"
2. Try closing and running `run.bat` / `run.sh` again
3. Make sure port 8000 is not in use

### "Database connection failed"
**Problem:** Can't reach PostgreSQL
**Fix:**
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify DATABASE_URL in `backend/.env` is exactly as provided
3. The database is hosted online - make sure no firewall blocks it

### Still stuck?

1. Close all terminal windows
2. Delete `backend/.env`
3. Start from Step 2 again
