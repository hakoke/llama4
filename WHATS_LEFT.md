## 🔑 What I Need From You

### Immediate
1. **EC2 Public IP** (waiting for you to launch)
2. **Serper API Key** (free at https://serper.dev)
   - Sign up
   - Get API key
   - Add to `.env`

### Optional (Nice to Have)
3. **RapidAPI Key** (for better Instagram scraping)
   - Not critical, basic scraping works without it
