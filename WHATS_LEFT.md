## 🚧 WHAT'S LEFT

### 🔄 Active Implementation Checklist (Updated)

1. **Backend – Group Arena Flow**
   - Typing halos: include alias badge/color in WebSocket typing payloads and render halo pulses per alias on the frontend.
   - Server-timed phases: replace client `sleep` reliance with authoritative timers that block late submissions and auto-advance if the client stalls.
   - Mind Game reveal payload: broadcast alias, latency, and submission order for the animated reveal stack, plus a summary highlighting the AI answers.
   - Latency tracking per message: capture human typing start/stop to populate `GameMessage.latency_ms` for AI mimicry.

2. **Frontend – Mind Games & React UI**
   - Typing halos & indicators: animate alias halos in chat and display synchronized "typing..." badges.
   - Answer submission states: show sending/delivered status, lock editing after timeout, and surface deadline miss errors.
   - Reveal experience: add flip animations, audio cues, latency badges, AI answer highlights, and screen reader narration.
   - Accessibility & animations: implement reduced-motion mode, focus management, keyboard shortcuts, contrast validation, and ARIA live regions.
   - Audio cues: integrate timer warnings, reveal stingers, ambient loops, and volume controls.

3. **AI Layer**
   - Memory retrieval: wire up vector embedding storage and retrieval so Qwen conditions on historic facts.
   - Latency modeling: delay responses based on per-alias latency observations and log actual delays for calibration.
   - Group blend prompt: validate `group_blend` against the memory pipeline and enforce persona diversity.
   - Post-game analysis: weave mind-game answers, latency mimicry, and cross-game insights into `universal_knowledge` updates.

4. **Results Screen**
   - Display mind-game reveals with alias attribution, AI deception metrics, latency stats, and link into the updated "brutally honest" AI profile.

5. **Miscellaneous Polish**
   - Echo typing halos in the React stage after the reveal chat.
   - Ensure alias profiles expose accessible fallback text (badges, ARIA labels).
   - Add optional haptic hooks for supported mobile devices.
   - Enforce the 3-5-2 minute timeline consistently across client and server.

### Frontend (Legacy Checklist)
- ⏳ Game lobby UI
- ⏳ Learning phase chat interface
- ⏳ Loading/research screen with animations
- ⏳ Group chat mode UI
- ⏳ Private chat mode UI
- ⏳ Voting interface
- ⏳ Results/reveal screen
- ⏳ Animations & timers
- ⏳ WebSocket integration
- ⏳ Responsive design

### Backend Polish (Minor)
- ⏳ Add EC2 model URL when ready
- ⏳ Test WebSocket connections
- ⏳ Add error handling
- ⏳ Add rate limiting
- ⏳ Optimize AI response time

### Integration
- ⏳ Connect frontend to backend API
- ⏳ Connect frontend to WebSocket
- ⏳ Test full game flow
- ⏳ Deploy to Railway

## 🔑 What I Need From You

### Immediate
1. **EC2 Public IP** (waiting for you to launch)
2. **Serper API Key** (free at https://serper.dev)
   - Sign up
   - Get API key
   - Add to `.env`

### Optional (Nice to Have)
3. **RapidAPI Key** (for better Instagram scraping)
   - Not critical, basic scraping works without it
