# 🎯 Implementation Complete: Full Feature Rally

## ✅ All Tasks Completed

### 1. Backend – Group Arena Flow ✓

**Typing Halo Payloads**
- WebSocket `send_typing_indicator` now broadcasts alias badge, color, and name
- Backend tracks typing sessions via `PhaseScheduler.typing_sessions`
- Typing start/stop events captured with `mark_typing_start()` and `consume_typing_latency()`

**Authoritative Phase Timing**
- `PhaseScheduler` extended with:
  - `record_stage_deadline()` / `get_stage_deadline()` / `stage_expired()`
  - `record_mind_game_deadline()` / `get_mind_game_deadline()`
  - Server-side deadline validation before accepting chat messages and mind-game submissions
- Late submissions rejected with error payloads (`chat_error`, `mind_game_error`)
- Forced phase transitions when client stalls (auto-advance to react/voting)

**Mind Game Reveal Broadcast**
- `collect_mind_game_reveal()` enhanced to include:
  - `submission_index` and `submission_order` per response
  - `summary` object with latency stats (fastest, slowest, average), AI count, human count, AI aliases
  - Responses sorted by `submitted_at` timestamp + latency
- `maybe_broadcast_mind_game_reveal()` function broadcasts enriched payload with summary

**Latency Tracking**
- Human typing latency captured via `phase_scheduler.mark_typing_start/consume_typing_latency`

- Fallback to 1200-3500ms if no data available

**Group Blend Validation & Persona Diversity**
- `persona_use_count` tracks how often each persona is used per game
- Weighted selection boosts underused personas (weight = 1.0 / (1.0 + use_count * 0.3))
- Fallback persona selection uses cumulative weighting for diversity
- Updated prompt emphasizes strategic rotation and unpredictability

**Enhanced Post-Game Analysis**
- `generate_game_analysis()` now accepts:
  - `mind_game_data`: reveals + summaries
  - `latency_stats`: average/min/max per player

**Latency Data**
- Player dossiers now include "Latency profile: XXms avg" if data available
- Expandable profiles show full breakdown per player

**Brutally Honest AI Profile**
- Player dossiers expandable with `+`/`−` icons
- `.expanded` class reveals full notes, discovery, latency profile
- Smooth max-height transition animation
- CSS: `.insight-content` with `.expanded` modifier

## 📊 Data Flow

### Latency Tracking Flow
1. User starts typing → `onTyping(true)` → `phase_scheduler.mark_typing_start()`
2. User sends message → `phase_scheduler.consume_typing_latency()` → `latency_ms` stored in `GameMessage`
3. AI observes latency → `ai_impersonator.record_latency()` → cached for mimicry
4. AI responds → `compute_mimicked_latency()` → realistic delay applied
5. Results screen → `latencyStats` shows per-player breakdown

### Mind Game Flow
1. Prompt broadcast → `phase_scheduler.mind_game_start_times` tracks start
2. User submits → latency calculated, stored in `MindGameResponse`
3. Deadline expires → `maybe_broadcast_mind_game_reveal()` triggered
4. Reveal payload includes sorted responses + summary (latencies, AI count)
5. Results screen shows full recap with AI flags

### Memory Retrieval Flow
1. Universal knowledge entries stored during AI reflection
2. `ai_respond_in_group()` queries `UniversalKnowledge` table
3. Top 8 high-confidence patterns pulled
4. Passed to `group_blend()` as `memory_context`
5. AI prompt includes prior facts section
